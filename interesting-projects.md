### Research Projects
I am working actively on and contributing to the following research projects:

---

#### Challenges and Opportunities for Prompt Management
Accepted at MuC 2024, our paper examines the usability of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, focusing on prompt management. From a survey of 61 users, we identified the need for better search functions and labeling. We also highlight how efficient prompt management can reduce AI's environmental impact, promoting more sustainable AI practices.

#### Data-Driven Persona Creation, Validation, and Evolution
Our paper introduces a data-driven approach to automate and continuously update personas using user feedback and monitoring data. This method aims to make persona development more efficient and accurate, improving user experience while reducing redundant efforts for greater sustainability.

#### Data-Driven Estimation for Feature Implementation
This project aims to develop a data-driven method to estimate the human and time resources needed for new software features. By analyzing historical data, we seek to improve resource estimation and train AI models for better predictions. Our goal is to make feature development more efficient and accurate.
