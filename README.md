I am currently serving as a research associate at FHNW (University of Applied Sciences and Arts, Northwestern Switzerland) within the [Institute for Interactive Technologies](https://www.fhnw.ch/en/about-fhnw/schools/school-of-engineering/institutes/institute-for-interactive-technologies).

I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Bern. Between 2018 and 2022, I was a member of the [Software Composition Group](https://scg.unibe.ch/) led by Prof. Oscar Nierstrasz. My work primarily focuses on requirements engineering, with a strong interest in UX, digital sustainability, and improving agile way of development.
