I am currently a research associate at FHNW (University of Applied Sciences and Arts, Northwestern Switzerland) in the [Institute for Interactive Technologies](https://www.fhnw.ch/en/about-fhnw/schools/school-of-engineering/institutes/institute-for-interactive-technologies).  
I finished my Ph.D. from the University of Bern in the Software Composition Group. 
Broadly speaking, I work in the requirements engineering domain, and particularly I am interested in involving various stakeholders in the software development process by providing them a minimum number of tools with the right interfaces. 

Check out my doctoral research thesis, titled [Supporting Multiple Stakeholders in Agile Development](./moldable-requirements.md).<br><br>


### Academic career

Check out my [Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=y4KM2XAAAAAJ&hl=en) for the latest publications.<br>

In the past, I have been the main teaching assistant for the lecture [Introduction to Software Engineering](http://scg.unibe.ch/teaching/ese) (2018-present). My main responsibilities, among others, were to think and plan a full semester development project for roughly 50-60 students. Students are divided into teams of 4-5 and build a toy web application to practice fundamental concepts of software engineering, for instance object-oriented design and modeling. They also practice Scrum, cost estimation, and project management.
