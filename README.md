I am currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Bern in the Software Composition Group. Broadly speaking, I work in the requirements engineering domain, and particularly I am interested in involving several people in the software development process by providing them a minimum number of tools with the right interfaces. 

Check out my Ph.D. research proposal, which I call [Moldable Requirements](./moldable-requirements.md).
