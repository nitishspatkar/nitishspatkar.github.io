I am currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Bern in the Software Composition Group. Broadly speaking, I work in the requirements engineering domain, and particularly I am interested in involving several people in the software development process by providing them a minimum number of tools with the right interfaces. 

Check out my Ph.D. research proposal, which I call [Moldable Requirements](./moldable-requirements.md).<br><br>

##### Moldable scenarios
In this project, we surveyed popular BDD tools and analyzed their support to engage multiple stakeholders in the BDD process, particularly in IDEs.
We propose an approach and present an advanced prototype implmentation to enable non-technical stakeholders to iteratively create scenarios and inspect corresponding domain objects with suitable interfaces and representations.

I have been the main teaching assistant for the lecture [Introduction to Software Engineering](http://scg.unibe.ch/teaching/ese) (2018-present). My main responsibilities, among others, are to think and plan a full semester development project for roughly 50-60 students. Students are divided into teams of 4-5 and build a toy web application to practice fundamental concepts of software engineering, such as object-oriented design and modeling. They also practice Scrum, cost estimation, project management, etc.
