I am currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Bern in the Software Composition Group. Broadly speaking, I work in the requirements engineering domain, and particularly I am interested in involving several people in the software development process by providing them a minimum number of tools with the right interfaces. 

Check out my Ph.D. research proposal, which I call [Moldable Requirements](./moldable-requirements.md).<br><br>

I have been the main teaching assistant for the lecture [Introduction to Software Engineering](http://scg.unibe.ch/teaching/ese) (2018-present). My main responsibilities, among others, are to think and plan a full semester development project for roughly 50-60 students. Students are divided into teams of 4-5 and build a toy web application to practice fundamental concepts of software engineering, such as object-oriented design and modeling. They also practice Scrum, cost estimation, project management, etc.
