I am currently serving as a research associate at FHNW (University of Applied Sciences and Arts, Northwestern Switzerland) within the [Institute for Interactive Technologies](https://www.fhnw.ch/en/about-fhnw/schools/school-of-engineering/institutes/institute-for-interactive-technologies).

I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Bern. Between 2018 and 2022, I was a member of the [Software Composition Group](https://scg.unibe.ch/) led by Prof. Oscar Nierstrasz. My work primarily focuses on requirements engineering, with a strong interest in UX, digital sustainability, and improving agile way of development.

### Projects I personally find interesting 
<div class="projects-container">
        <div class="project-card">
    <h3>Challenges and Opportunities for Prompt Management</h3>
    <p>Accepted at MuC 2024, our paper investigates the usability and user experience of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, with a focus on prompt management. Through an empirical survey of 61 users, we identified challenges in organizing and managing prompts. Our study highlights the need for advanced search functionalities, labeling, and innovative interface designs to enhance efficiency. Importantly, we emphasize the sustainability aspect, as efficient prompt management can significantly reduce the environmental impact of AI technologies. By guiding the development of more user-friendly and sustainable genAI tools, we aim to promote eco-friendly practices in the rapidly growing field of AI.</p>

    <h3>Data-Driven Persona Creation, Validation, and Evolution</h3>
    <p>Submitted for SNSF BRIDGE Proof of Concept funding, our paper introduces a data-driven approach to automate the creation, validation, and evolution of personas. By leveraging user feedback and monitoring data, we aim to streamline the persona development process, making it more efficient and accurate. Our research highlights the importance of continuously updating personas to reflect actual user behaviors and needs, thus enhancing the relevance and impact of software design. This approach not only improves user experience but also promotes sustainable practices by reducing redundant development efforts.</p>

    <h3>Data-Driven Estimation for Feature Implementation</h3>
    <p>This work-in-progress project aims to develop a data-driven method to accurately estimate the human and time resources required for implementing new features in software projects. By analyzing historical data from feature branches and issues labeled as 'feature,' we seek to answer high-level questions regarding the roles, skills, and project management aspects involved in feature implementation. This approach will provide empirical evidence to improve resource estimation, train AI models for better predictions, and inform other engineering disciplines such as product lines. Ultimately, our goal is to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of feature development in software projects.</p>
