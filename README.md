I am currently serving as a research associate at FHNW (University of Applied Sciences and Arts, Northwestern Switzerland) within the [Institute for Interactive Technologies](https://www.fhnw.ch/en/about-fhnw/schools/school-of-engineering/institutes/institute-for-interactive-technologies).

Explore the list of [innovative industry projects I have been involved in](./projects.md).

I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Bern, specifically from the [Software Composition Group](https://scg.unibe.ch/) under the guidance of Prof. Oscar Nierstrasz. My work primarily focuses on requirements engineering, with a keen interest in engaging various stakeholders in the software development process by providing them with a minimal number of tools complemented by the appropriate interfaces.

Discover my doctoral research thesis, titled [Supporting Multiple Stakeholders in Agile Development](./moldable-requirements.md).

Also, review the [list of bachelor's, master's theses, and other student projects](./thesus.md) that I have supervised.
