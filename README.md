I am currently a research associate at FHNW (University of Applied Sciences and Arts, Northwestern Switzerland) in the [Institute for Interactive Technologies](https://www.fhnw.ch/en/about-fhnw/schools/school-of-engineering/institutes/institute-for-interactive-technologies).  

Check out the list of [innovative industry projects I have been involved in](./projects.md).

I finished my Ph.D. from the University of Bern in the [Software Composition Group](https://scg.unibe.ch/) under Prof. Oscar Nierstrasz. 
Broadly speaking, I work in the requirements engineering domain, and particularly I am interested in involving various stakeholders in the software development process by providing them a minimum number of tools with the right interfaces. 

Check out my doctoral research thesis, titled [Supporting Multiple Stakeholders in Agile Development](./moldable-requirements.md).
