### Projects

#### Moldable scenarios
In this project, we surveyed popular BDD tools and analyzed their support to engage multiple stakeholders in the BDD process, particularly in IDEs.
We propose an approach and present an advanced prototype implmentation to enable non-technical stakeholders to iteratively create scenarios and inspect corresponding domain objects with suitable interfaces and representations.

#### Moldable artifacts
In this project, we surveyed the literature to compile a list of various artifacts used in the software development process, particularly in requirements engineering.
We study and report the characteristics of the artifacts, such as their suitability for multiple stakeholders and their flow within the development lifecycle.
We propose an approach and present an advanced prototype implementation, wherein we model requirements hierarchies and corresponding artifacts as first-class citizens in an IDE.
